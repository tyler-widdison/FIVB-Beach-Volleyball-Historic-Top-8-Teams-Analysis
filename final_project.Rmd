### **Tyler Widdison**

  *Evaluation of winning trends related to court and hour for the top 8 FIVB Beach volleyball teams per gender since 2001. The concluding hypothesis is that teams ranked within the top 8 have a higher probability at winning on court 1 at 09:00. Generalized linear model is used in support of the hypothesis. Notes: __^Court records are not kept by FIVB until 2009. ^^Hour records are not kept by FIVB until 2004__*

### *Conclusion*
#### There is an apparent trend of teams in the top 8 winning more and having higher probility of winning on lower courts earlier in the day. And lower probility later in the day on higher courts. This trend is likely due to teams in the top 8 advancing further into tournaments and playing other teams in the top 8.
